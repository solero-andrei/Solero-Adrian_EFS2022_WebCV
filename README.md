## Create a single page website with the following navigation. 
1. Biography - this will take you the section of the page that gives information such as Name, Date of Birth and other personal details
2. Skills - note skills related to course being taken. A rating (star) can be presented
3. Hobbies - non-related to your course. What you do on your personal time
4. References - provide 3 character references. Present this a carousel or card images.

This should not change url/route but just scroll to respective sections. Hint: Use id #[id]
